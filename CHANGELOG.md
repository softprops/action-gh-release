## 0.1.5

- Added support for specifying tag name [#39](https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release/pull/39)

## 0.1.3

- Fixed where `with: body_path` was not being used in generated GitHub releases

## 0.1.2

- Add support for merging draft releases [#16](https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release/pull/16)

GitHub's api doesn't explicitly have a way of fetching a draft release by tag name which caused draft releases to appear as separate releases when used in a build matrix.
This is now fixed.

- Add support for newline-delimited asset list [#18](https://github.com/softprops/action-gh-release/pull/18)

GitHub actions inputs don't inherently support lists of things and one might like to append a list of files to include in a release. Previously this was possible using a comma-delimited list of asset path patterns to upload. You can now provide these as a newline delimieted list for better readability

```yaml
- name: Release
  uses: softprops/action-gh-release@v1
  if: startsWith(github.ref, 'refs/tags/')
  with:
    files: |
      filea.txt
      fileb.txt
      filec.txt
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
